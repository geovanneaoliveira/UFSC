**************************************************
* Level 1 SPICE Models for the 4007 CMOS chip
**************************************************
* These Level 1 models were extracted from measured results. The
* model attempts to account for the package parasitics. The simulated and
* typical measured device capacitances are as follows:
*
*    NMOS: Cgs = 18pF   Cds = 14pF
*    PMOS: Cgs = 17pF   Cds = 26pF
*
* Gate-to-drain capacitances were not extracted but were adjusted to
* to help fit measured results.
